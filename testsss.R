## The 1st function will accept and cache a square, invertible matrix.
## The second function will accept the first function and provide
## the inverse of the given matrix. The inverted matrix will 
## then be cached. the cache feature alleviates additional 
## computational burden associated with the required linear
## algebra necessary to perform the inverse operation.
## My functions relied heavily upon the provided examples.

## This matrix uses a reasonably large matrix to highlight the 
## benefit of caching data for computationally large workloads.

## This second function takes a variable that assigns the matrix to the
## first function producing am inverse matrix. If the results are 
## already cached then the cached result will be produced.
